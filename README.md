# AIMaxTheatre
A simulated theatre experience written in c++.

This was created as a project for school.

Currently it starts with a ticketing menu to choose which movie would like to be seen. It then moves to a concessions stand where concessions selections can be made. 

The project is written in c++ using object oriented design.
